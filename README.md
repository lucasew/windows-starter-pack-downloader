# Windows Starter Pack Downloader

I don't actually use Windows, but I need to do maintenance and format some
machines and this is what I use in the post install phase.

This repo is only an automation for me to update the stuff I carry on my USB
stick automatically.

I still didn't automate the download of the ISO itself tho, but that LTSC from
2021 I am using is still low maintenance, like no need to install a crapload of
updates after first boot.

Future work is build a ISO using some automated tool to download the updates.

I have no idea when I will iterate on these automations again as me using
Windows is a really rare event.
